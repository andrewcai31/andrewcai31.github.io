# Why Static Sites?

Static site generators like Jekyll offer several advantages over traditional dynamic websites.

## Performance

Static sites are incredibly fast because they're pre-built and served as plain HTML files. No database queries, no server-side processing, just pure speed.

## Security

With no server-side code execution, static sites are inherently more secure. There are fewer attack vectors and vulnerabilities to worry about.

## Cost

Static sites can be hosted for free or very cheaply on platforms like:
- GitHub Pages
- Netlify
- Vercel
- Cloudflare Pages

## Simplicity

The build process is straightforward:
1. Write content in markdown
2. Build the site
3. Deploy to hosting

## Version Control

Since the entire site is just files, you can use Git for version control, making collaboration and rollbacks easy.

## Conclusion

For content-focused websites, static site generators provide an excellent balance of performance, security, and simplicity.
