# My First Post

Welcome to my first blog post! This post demonstrates the markdown and LaTeX capabilities of this Jekyll site.

## Markdown Features

This site supports standard markdown features:

### Code Blocks

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
    return "Success"
```

### Lists

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

### Emphasis

*Italic text* and **bold text** are supported.

## LaTeX Math Support

This site also supports LaTeX math expressions using KaTeX:

### Inline Math

The quadratic formula is: $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$

### Block Math

The Pythagorean theorem states:

$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$

### More Complex Math

The Euler's identity:

$$
e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0
$$

This beautiful equation combines five fundamental mathematical constants: 0, 1, e, i, and Ï€.

## Conclusion

This demonstrates that the site can handle both simple markdown content and complex mathematical expressions, making it suitable for technical writing and academic content.
