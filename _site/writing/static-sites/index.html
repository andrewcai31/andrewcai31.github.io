<h1 id="why-static-sites">Why Static Sites?</h1>

<p>Static site generators like Jekyll offer several advantages over traditional dynamic websites.</p>

<h2 id="performance">Performance</h2>

<p>Static sites are incredibly fast because theyâ€™re pre-built and served as plain HTML files. No database queries, no server-side processing, just pure speed.</p>

<h2 id="security">Security</h2>

<p>With no server-side code execution, static sites are inherently more secure. There are fewer attack vectors and vulnerabilities to worry about.</p>

<h2 id="cost">Cost</h2>

<p>Static sites can be hosted for free or very cheaply on platforms like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>GitHub Pages</li>
  <li>Netlify</li>
  <li>Vercel</li>
  <li>Cloudflare Pages</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="simplicity">Simplicity</h2>

<p>The build process is straightforward:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Write content in markdown</li>
  <li>Build the site</li>
  <li>Deploy to hosting</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="version-control">Version Control</h2>

<p>Since the entire site is just files, you can use Git for version control, making collaboration and rollbacks easy.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>For content-focused websites, static site generators provide an excellent balance of performance, security, and simplicity.</p>
