Jekyll Themes is a great resource for finding beautiful themes for your Jekyll website. The site features a wide variety of themes, from minimalist designs like "no style, please" to more complex layouts.

The theme I used for this website, "no style, please", is particularly interesting because it focuses on content over design, with under 1kb of CSS while still maintaining excellent readability and responsiveness.
